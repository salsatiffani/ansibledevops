Ansible is a configuration management tool. These tools are now ubiquitous in modern computing environments, but although they actually had their beginnings in the 1950s at the US Department of Defense, it has taken a long time for them to be applied to computing environments. Until quite recently, configuration management was a rather manual process of checks and balances, with strict change management controls. These days, weâ€™ve moved a few layers beyond this, where we describe the end state we require and allow the tools to figure out the best way to make that happen.
